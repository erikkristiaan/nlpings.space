### Installation & Building the application
1. Install Docker Desktop on your machine. ([Follow the installation instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

2. Clone the development environment with:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/erikkristiaan/nlpings.space.git
    ```

3. Create a file for environment variables with:
     ```
     cd nlpings.space && cp .env.example .env
     ```

4. Set up the environment variables in the `.env` file.
    - Open the newly created `.env` file in a text editor.
    - You will need to provide `mongodb` with name to use for the database, along with a username and password for authentication.
    - For the reddit python scraper, provide an account with a username and password. Because authentication credentials are currently stored in plain text in the `.env` file, it's recommended to use an alt or a burner account for this purpose.
    - Finally, you will need to generate an OAuth token (Reddit API client ID & Reddit API client secret) to use reddit's API
        - From the reddit account you intend to use, navigate to App Preferences: https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps
        - Click `create another app` at the bottom.
        - [Fill out the required details.](https://i.imgur.com/4QbEmu7.png) Make sure to select `script` and click `create app`.
        - [Add the newly generated reddit API client ID and secret to the `.env` file.](https://i.imgur.com/6yoK823.png)

3. Build and run the containers with docker.
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the app running live. It will take a bit of time for the scraper to start populating the database (this is mainly due to reddit rate-limiting use of their API).
